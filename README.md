# fi-firefox-emergency-spell

Firefox lost Finnish spellcheck. This is an attempt to make a first-aid fix and create a Finnish spellcheck for Firefox.

# What is this?

A mere list of (quite many) Finnish words. No affix information, no new inflections. This will cover your daily usage, especially if you are a foreigner like myself, who wants to avoid typical mistakes. The source of the data is a list of words gathered from an Internet crawl and filtered using [Omorfi](https://github.com/flammie/omorfi) to only keep Finnish words.

# Is this a hack?

Oh yes. Feel free to not use this and if you use this, you definitely should switch to Voikko once it is again available. But in the meantime, this is probably a lot better than nothing, especially for foreigners.

# Should I flame you for distributing this hack?

No. Contribute a better one.
