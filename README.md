# fi-firefox-emergency-spell

Firefox lost Finnish spellcheck. This is an attempt to make a first-aid fix and create a Finnish spellcheck for Firefox by simply listing 750,000 words of Finnish. Quick'n'dirty, yes, but it will be helpful to many and is much better than nothing. :)

You may need to then go to menu / add-ons / gear wheel top right / install add-on from file

# What is this?

A mere list of Finnish words. No affix information, no new inflections. This will cover your daily usage, especially if you are a foreigner like myself, who wants to avoid typical mistakes. The source of the data is a list of words gathered from an Internet crawl and filtered using [giellatekno's Finnish transducer](http://giellatekno.uit.no/) to only keep Finnish words.

# Is this a hack?

Oh yes. Feel free to not use this and if you use this, you definitely should switch to Voikko once it is again available. But in the meantime, this is probably a lot better than nothing, especially for foreigners.

# Should I flame you for distributing this hack?

No. Make a better one.
